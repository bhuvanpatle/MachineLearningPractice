## Introduction
The repository covers various machine learning topics and algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It is intended for students to gain practical experience and deepen their understanding of machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Lab1**, **Lab2**, ...: Each folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for different lab sessions, focusing on specific machine learning topics.
- **Datasets**: This folder includes datasets used in the exercises.
- **Utils**: Utility scripts for common functions used across labs.
- **README.md**: This document.

## Installation
To run the notebooks, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed. The recommended steps are:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhuvanpatle/MachineLearningPractice.git
   cd MachineLearningPractice
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to the respective lab folder and open the Jupyter Notebook to start practicing.
